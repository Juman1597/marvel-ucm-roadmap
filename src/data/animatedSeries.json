    "overview": "X-Men '97 continues the story of X-Men (1992). In both series, mutants are individuals born with superhuman abilities that typically manifest during puberty. The X-Men are a team of mutant superheroes founded by Professor Charles Xavier to protect both mutants and humans. At the end of The Animated Series, Xavier nearly dies in an assassination attempt and is taken into space to be healed by the alien Shi'ar Empire. X-Men '97 begins a year later and sees the X-Men facing new challenges without Xavier, under the leadership of their former adversary, Magneto. Like the original series, X-Men '97 combines action, soap opera-style drama, and the exploration of serious topics.",
